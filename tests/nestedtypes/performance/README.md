# Todo

We need new perfromance test which would represent the reality we're dealing with.

Large data structures comes from the server.

There are two situations - empty set and merge set. Both must be checked.

From UI standpoint - single field modification deep inside of the tree must be measured,
with validation. Ideally - links performance. 

## Large collections (50K).

- Large collection, narrow models
- Large collection, wide models.

## Deep model trees

- Large tree, narrow models
- Large tree, wide models

## Mixed tree.

- Recursive model tree
- 10K collection of recursive model tree.  

## Links performance

- Boolean deep inside the tree
- Text link with validation deep inside the tree.
