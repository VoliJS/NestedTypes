# Getting Started

master: [![Master Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Volicon/backbone.nestedTypes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Volicon/backbone.nestedTypes)
develop: [![Develop Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Volicon/backbone.nestedTypes.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Volicon/backbone.nestedTypes)

Version 1.0.0 is here. Highlights:

- New .has type specs syntax
- Huge performance improvement over vanilla backbonejs. Model updates are 4x faster in most browsers (20x faster in Chrome and nodejs).

## What it is

If you use `ReactJS` or `backbonejs` and ever wanted to use rich models with all the features, like in Ember.DS, look no further.

NestedTypes is full-featured model framework, built on the top of backbonejs. It does the same thing to the models and collections as Chaplin or Marionette does to views. Design philosophy behing it is simple - the less code you write for the task, the more productive you are.

One more important thing to mention. NestedTypes models are fast. Look at the performance comparison with Backbone models in Chrome:

![Backbone vs NestedTypes](docs/performance.jpg)

No kidding, you can execute this test by yourself opening `test.perf.html`.

### Complex attribute types

* Cross-browser handling of Date.
* Nested models and collections.
* One-to-many and many-to-many model relationships.

It's achieved using attribute type annotations, which feels in much like statically typed programming language. Yet, this annotations are vanilla JavaScript, no transpiler step is required.

### Safety

NestedTypes check types on every model update and perform dynamic type casts to ensure that attributes will always hold values of proper type.

As result, NestedTypes models are extremely reliable. It's impossible to break client-server protocol with inaccurate attribute assignment. If something will go really wrong, it will fix an error and warn you with a messages in the console.

### Performance
NestedTypes uses attribute type information for sophisticated optimizations targeting modern JS JIT engines.

Compared to backbonejs, model updates are about 20 times faster in Chrome/nodejs, and 4 times faster in other browsers.

### Easy to use and learn
NestedTypes was originally designed with an idea to make backbonejs more friendly for newbiews.

What we do, is taking intuitive newbie approach to backbonejs, and turn it from the mistake to legal way of doing things.

```javascript
var User = Nested.Model.extend({
    urlRoot : '/api/users',

    defaults : {
        // Primitive types
        login    : "", // String
        email    : String.value( null ), // null, but String
        loginCount : Number.has.toJSON( false ) // 0, not serialized
        active   : Boolean.value( true ), // true

        created  : Date, // new Date()

        settings : Settings, // new Settings()

        // collection of models, received as an array of model ids
        roles    : Role.Collection.subsetOf( rolesCollection ),
        // reference to model, received as model id.
        office   : Office.from( officeCollection )
    }
});

var collection = new User.Collection();
collection.fetch().done( function(){
    var user = collection.first();
    console.log( user.name ); // native properties
    console.log( user.office.name );
    console.log( user.roles.first().name );
});
```
> Types are being checked in run-time on assignment, but instead of throwing exceptions it tries to cast values to defined types.

```javascript
    user.login = 1;
    console.assert( user.login === "1" );

    user.active = undefined;
    console.assert( user.active === false );

    user.loginCount = "hjkhjkhfjkhjkfd";
    console.assert( _.isNan( user.loginCount ) );

    user.settings = { timeZone : 180 }; // same as user.settings.set({ timeZone : 180 })
    console.assert( user.settings instanceof Settings );
```
## Installation & Requirements
> CommonJS (node.js, browserify):

```javascript
var Nested = require( 'nestedtypes' );
```

> CommonJS/AMD (RequireJS).
> 'backbone' and 'underscore' modules must be defined in config paths.

```javascript
require([ 'nestedtypes' ], function( Nested ){ ... });
```

> Browser's script tag

```html
<script src="underscore.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="backbone.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="nestedtypes.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script> var Model = Nested.Model; ... </script>
```

### Supported JS environments
NestedTypes requires modern JS environment with support for native properties.
It's tested in `IE 9+`, `Chrome`, `Safari`, `Firefox`, which currently gives you about 95%
of all browsers being used for accessing the web.

`node.js` and `io.js` are also supported.

### Packaging and dependencies

NestedTypes itself is packaged as UMD (Universal Module Definition) module, and should load dependencies properly in any environment.

NestedTypes require `underscore` and `backbone` libraries. They either must be included globally with `<script>`tag or, if `CommonJS`/`AMD` loaders are used, be accessible by their standard module names.  

### bower

`bower install backbone.nested-types`

### npm

`npm install backbone.nested-types`

### Manual
Copy `nestedtypes.js` file to desired location.
