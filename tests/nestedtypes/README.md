# NestedTypes 1.3 Regression Tests

Tests suite taken as is from NestedTypes 1.3.X. Used for basic regression testing.

As usual, an ultimate regression is an ability to run Volicon Observer product (SPA of ~100 KLOCs) with the recent version of the framework.

## To run

- Do `npm install`
- Open `index.html` for functional tests
- Open `performance.html` for performance test vs `backbonejs`
